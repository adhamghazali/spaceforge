A Sloan Farms sign swings in the breeze on Oct. 8, 2018, in Mountain Grove. The sign was given to <PERSON> and <PERSON> as a Christmas gift from their son. The farm allowed them to put both of their children through college without taking out student loans. <PERSON> said it was important to him and his wife to give their children the opportunity to get a college degree because neither of them had the chance to do so.
